Chris is a senior software developer at Carbon Five.  Although he started out writing C he found his true love was building applications on the web.  These days he spends most of his time in Elixir and Javascript, trying to push the web to itâ€™s limits.  When not writing code for work, Chris can be found writing code for fun, talking about the joys of functional programming, roasting coffee, or building legos with his kids.
