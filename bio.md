Chris is a senior software developer at Carbon Five where he spends his time hacking on Elixir, Ruby, Java and Javascript.  Although he started out writing C he found his true love was building applications on the web.  These days he spends most of his time in Elixir, trying to make other programmer's lives easier.  When not writing code for work, Chris can be found writing code for fun, talking about the joys of functional programming, playing pinball, roasting coffee, or building lego with his kids.
