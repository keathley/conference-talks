# Well Typed Elixir

As developers, types are a part of our lives. Far too often types are seen as annoyances instead of as design tools. This leads many developers to cast aside their types often to their detriment.

In this talk we'll explore ways that we can leverage Elixir's type system to produce safer, more correct, and better tested code, without giving up the benefits of a dynamic language. Specifically we'll talk about success typing with type specs and dialyzer. We'll also explore experimental ways to use typespecs for runtime checking and generative testing.
