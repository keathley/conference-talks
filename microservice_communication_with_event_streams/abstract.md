Microservices are becoming the standard architecture for both established companies and early stage startups. But, as anyone who has worked on large distributed systems will tell you, communicating between services is daunting. This communication impacts everything from performance to state management to development and testing. When faced with these challenges we decided to take a different approach to service communication by using with event streams powered by Kafka.

In this talk we'll dive into a set of real world services and explain how we can use event streams to facilitate communication between them. We'll also explore Kafka's semantics and why it its a good choice for these types of problems. Finally we'll look at the benefits of this architecture as well as some of the potential pitfalls.
