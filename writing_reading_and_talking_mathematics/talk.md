# Descrption

As engineers we're consistently challenged with new problems.
Often times these problems are outside of our initial reach. In order to
solve them we have to use a modeling techniques combined with our previous
experiences. Learning how to solve problems in this way is difficult and
it can leave many people feeling lost.

In 1995, Ken Winograd and Karen M. Higgins presented a paper that examined
the concept of "problem writing" and how it could be used to effectively
teach children mathematics.

In this talk we'll see two distinct viewpoints on learning, examine the
nature of problem solving, and discuss ways that we can apply problem
writing in our work.
