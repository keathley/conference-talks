# Moving from Rails to Phoenix

Rails is beloved by startups and early stage companies as a quick way to test ideas and gain user feedback. But, on a long enough time line performance problems inherent to the framework can begin to present themselves. These performance problems mean more cost and more overhead for maintenance.

Faced with these problems we recently converted an application from Rails to Phoenix; a web framework developed in elixir.

In this talk we'll discuss the motivation for that migration, our strategy for an incremental re-write, and the benefits and pitfalls of moving from Rails to Phoenix.
