Elixir is a functional language built for the Erlang VM. Because it targets the BEAM, Elixir can achieve unprecendented scalability and fault tolerance.

At Le Tote we love Elixir. In fact, we love it so much that we attempt to deploy it everywhere. This includes everything from our web services on AWS to the custom hardware devices powering our fulfillment centers.

In this talk we'll share some of the lessons that we've learned building and deploying serveral large scale Elixir applications. We'll discuss how we've been able to utilize Elixir in traditional server applications as well as on embedded devices. Finally we'll look at some of the practical implications in choosing Elixir such as hiring, library support, and access to hard won knowledge.
