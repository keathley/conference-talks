* Consistent, Distributed Elixir

Elixir and Erlang provide powerful mechanisms for building systems that are
always available. But when it comes to building distributed systems that need
consistency erlang leaves many of the implementation details up to the
programmer.

In this talk we'll discuss the tradeoffs between systems that are
always on and systems that are consistent. We'll look at the types
of garauntees that standard erlang tooling gives us as well as their
shortcomings. Finally we'll look at several patterns and techniques for building
consistent, distributed systems using elixir.
