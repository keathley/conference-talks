## Become a pro at git.

Git has become the de facto standard source control solution for many open source projects and companies. But despite its wide adoption Git is a difficult tool to learn. While the basic operations of staging and committing files seem straightforward they can become challenging when working with many other people or when things start to go wrong.

In this talk we'll discuss ways to go beyond the basic git commands. We will look at several real world scenarios and then discuss ways that we can use Git's unique features to solve each scenario. Specifically we'll see techniques for managing branches with large teams, resolving merge conflicts, tracking down bugs, recovering "lost" commits, re-writing history, and several other techniques for taking your git skills to the next level.
